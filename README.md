# A-real-time-system-for-detecting-ambulance-locations
Driving safety has become an important topic for everyone today. Many modern cars are equipped with excellent noise reduction materials and most drivers often listen to music or radio stations while driving. Therefore, the driver may not pay attention to hear the sound of the ambulance. To my best knowledge, there are no systems for detecting the orientation of ambulances nowadays. Hence, we use Arduino and sound detect sensors to establish a system that can detect the orientation of ambulances in real-time. It can remind drivers with mobile phones as an ambulance approaches, thereby reducing the chances of car accidents with an ambulance.
